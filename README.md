TODO


run spell check on 5-10 repos and get the base words for the wordlist.txt file to put in the template

can we move the wordlist.txt file into some sort of config directory? .github/something maybe?

find out how to ignore requirements.txt file for misspellings

is there a way to check the history of vestigial code comments to use that to create better rules to check?



set it up so that once you push, you see the actions in the terminal.

look up what needs to be installed locally


Remaining work:

PR message standardization: Create a template with a prefilled body [@Nick Smith to propose]. Implemented as an MD file under the .github folder

Present tense args. Probably be another action. [@Nick Smith]
